# Arithmetic Operations
    QALU has arithmetic operators: adders and subtractors. 
***
## half_adder(circ, a, b, carry,sum_)
 **half_adder** adds two bits (**a**+**b**) and returns sum and carry. It has 5 arguments:
  * **circ** is QuantumCircuit that will be added half_adder
  * **a** is position of qubit that will be added
  *  **b** is position of qubit that will be added
  *  **carry** is position of qubit that has information of carry loaded
  *  **sum_** is position of qubit that has information of sum
